Extracting Image Details Using Generative AI with Streamlit

In this project, we aim to create an AI-powered web application that extracts detailed information from images utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) through Google Generative AI. This fully functional image-to-text converter, built with Python and Streamlit, enables users to upload images, query specific details, and save the results in TXT or CSV formats. The step-by-step guide covers everything from integrating the LLM to generating detailed image descriptions, making it an ideal project for those interested in Generative AI and web app development.

Key Features:


1.) Image details extraction using LLMs.
2.) Generative AI for image description.
3.) User-friendly Streamlit interface for image-to-text conversion.
4.) Capability to extract specific elements from images.
5.) Integration of Google Generative AI with Python.
6.) Support for saving output in TXT or CSV formats.
7.) Comprehensive guide for implementing LLMs in image analysis.
