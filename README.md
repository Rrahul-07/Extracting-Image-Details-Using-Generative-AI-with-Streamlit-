Extracting Image Details Using Generative AI with Streamlit

In this project, we aim to create an AI-powered web application that extracts detailed information from images utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) through Google Generative AI. This fully functional image-to-text converter, built with Python and Streamlit, enables users to upload images, query specific details, and save the results in TXT or CSV formats. The step-by-step guide covers everything from integrating the LLM to generating detailed image descriptions, making it an ideal project for those interested in Generative AI and web app development.
